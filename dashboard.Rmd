Data Overview
===================================== 

Row 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
### Introduction
This data set consists of data for whether or not a person is interested in leaving
their current job. This data comes from a company who hires their data science teams
by hosting workshops that are open to everyone, with the hope that they will be able
to find outstanding participants to poach from their current company. However, not
everyone who attends these workshops are looking for a job change. These participants
ultimately cause the host to loose money, as they are not getting a potential new
hire from the event. Because of this, the company wants to know whether or not 
a person is looking for a job change so that they can begin to only allow those individuals
to sign up for the workshop

Row 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Research Questions
The ultimate research question for this project is: "Is this person looking for a job
change in the field of data analytics"

In order to answer this question, I will be creating a random forest that will allow
for the host company to predict whether or not a participant is looking for a new job
